PYTORCH INSTALLATION
--------------------
Go to /home/soharab
We need to download and run the bash installation script for Anaconda.
Open the Terminal and run the following command

curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


Once the installation script is finished downloading, run it, and follow the prompts. We are going to use the defaults.

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

To start using Anaconda, we will need to refresh the terminal:
Run the following command:

source ~/.bashrc

Go to /home/soharab
Run the following command to activate conda

source miniconda3/bin/activate

The following prompt will be displayed:
(base) soharab@soet-gpu:~$

[ 
You may optionally run the following command in a terminal, otherwise, everytime you open the terminal, the base env will be auto activated. To turn it off, run the following command:
conda config --set auto_activate_base False
]

init conda 

Now that we have Anaconda installed and activated, it’s time to install PyTorch.

(base) soharab@soet-gpu:~$ 
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch

You’ll notice a prompt during installation, enter “y” to finish the installation.

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

When done, the prompy comes back.

Check that Torch has been successfully installed.
Activate python.
(base) soharab@soet-gpu:~$ python

Run the following code:

import torch
x = torch.rand(3, 7)
print(x)

Done!!!

To deactivate the base virtual environment, run:
conda deactivate

Your original prompt comes back.

soharab@soet-gpu:~$
